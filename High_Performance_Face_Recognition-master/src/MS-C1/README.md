- In "groups" folder, the MISM models are arranged in groups named as layer 1-5.


- Note that the l5back, layer3_2 are backup layers, which means they might be helpful in future work but we did not use in competition.


- In every group, modifiy eval.py to the dataset you want to evaluate, then mat files will be generated.


- Copy those mat files into "eval_extend/data" folder.


- Change the evaluation dataset or the voting strategy in  testall.py, then run it.
